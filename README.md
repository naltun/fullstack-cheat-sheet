##### Variables
A variable is a named reference to a value. These values can be of different data types or objects of Classes.

Examples:
```ruby
name = 'Noah'
age = 27

```

Variables can be reassigned values:
```ruby
job = 'Scientist'
job = 'Museum Curator'
puts job # => Museum Curator
```

Constants are like variables, except the values cannot be changed:
```ruby
FAV_FOOD = 'Pizza'

```
